# Data Cleaning Process

Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis workflow. It involves preparing a raw dataset by removing inconsistencies, errors, and irrelevant data. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps for cleaning a sample supermarket sales dataset.

## Step 1: Identifying and Removing Irrelevant Columns

- **Objective:** Identify and remove columns with missing or irrelevant data.

- **Action:**
  - Examine the dataset columns.
  - Identify columns with no or irrelevant data (e.g., "Customer Name" to "Sales").
  - Remove these columns to streamline the dataset.

## Step 2: Handling Missing Values

- **Objective:** Determine how to handle missing values.

- **Action:**
  - Check for missing values in the dataset.
  - Decide on the appropriate action for each case (e.g., removing, imputing, or integrating missing data).
  - In our case, the "Sales" column was empty and removed.

## Step 3: Removing Duplicates

- **Objective:** Detect and remove duplicate records to ensure data consistency.

- **Action:**
  - Focus on a unique identifier (e.g., "Order ID" in our case).
  - Find and remove duplicated records, retaining only the first occurrence.

## Step 4: Data Exploration

- **Objective:** Explore the data to understand its quality and identify outliers.

- **Action:**
  - Employ data visualization techniques, such as box plots, to analyze the "Quantity" column's distribution.

## Step 5: Handling Outliers

- **Objective:** Detect and address outliers that can affect the analysis.

- **Action:**
  - Use statistical methods to identify outliers (e.g., IQR method).
  - Remove outliers to maintain data integrity.

## Step 6: Data Scaling and Normalization

- **Objective:** Prepare the data for modeling by scaling and normalizing features with different scales.

- **Action:**
  - Apply scaling and normalization to relevant columns. For example, we applied it to the "Quantity" column.

## Step 7: Final Data Validation

- **Objective:** Perform a final check to ensure the dataset is free from inconsistencies.

- **Action:**
  - Verify that there are no missing values, duplicates, or outliers in the cleaned dataset.

By following these steps, you'll have a well-prepared dataset ready for various analytical techniques, including statistical analysis and machine learning. It's essential to adapt these cleaning steps based on your dataset's specific characteristics and analysis goals.
